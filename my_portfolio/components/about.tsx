        A Frontend Developer who loves building sleek, functional apps. I
        graduated from San Francisco State University with a degree in Computer
        Science. I thrive on bringing ideas to life, whether it's a web or
        mobile application. My passion lies in creating intuitive,
        high-performance user interfaces that enhance user experiences.
        <br /> <br />
        With a strong foundation in JavaScript, React, and modern front-end
        technologies, I enjoy tackling complex problems, optimizing performance,
        and delivering polished applications. Beyond coding, I love playing in a
        basketball rec league on Sundays and occasionally competing in badminton
        tournaments.
        <br /> <br />
        Letâ€™s build something awesome! ðŸš€
